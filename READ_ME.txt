Hello,

Here is our submission for the INF421 project "Approximation algorithms for geometric problems".

You can compile and run classes in the src directory, by giving as an input to PointCloudViewer a set of point in .off format (like in /data/pointClouds) for closest and farthest pairs computation, and by giving as an input to NetworkLayout a graph in .mtx format (like in /data/networks) for Fruchterman-Reingold computation.

You can also directly run the .jar in the bin directory by giving the same format of input as for the src.

Finally, you will find our project report as a pdf, giving the theoretical framework and the empirical performance of our implementation and optimisations.
